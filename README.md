This is a battleship game build using Vanilla JavaScript and Sass. One of the main purpose of this game was 
to learn test driven development using jest. It is my hardest project up to date but I was suprised that it easier to build with I initially thought. Granted I didn't went overboard with building out this game. Regardless, I'm happy with what I build and what I learned.
