Below are some issues that I'm working on currently:


0. Need to make sure players don't add extra ships after carrier. I tried updating the foo ( getting it       out of the setTimeout ) quickly but that causes can additional problem. It causes the div to changes it color ( sign of attacked ) while it is being placed. 


1. May also want to speed up the div changing for each loop up bit ( taking too much time ). Also, when no name
is submitted, the message won't change to playerOne wins/ playerTwo wins. ( return home -> pvp -> no name -> check ? 🤷‍♂️) 

also start adding the responsive codes ( mixin ).


2. Add intructions when playing the game for players. Add hovering effect showing which ships is being placed currently. 


3. Need to make computer logic

last hovering effect of carrier still lingers
