This is a battleship game build using Vanilla JavaScript and Sass.

Below are some issues that I'm working on currently:

0. Need to make sure players don't add extra ships after carrier. I tried updating the foo ( getting it       out of the setTimeout ) quickly but that causes can additional problem. It causes the div to changes it color ( sign of attacked ) while it is being placed. 

1. May also want to speed up the div changing for each loop up bit ( taking too much time ). Also, when no name
is submitted, the message won't change to playerOne wins/ playerTwo wins. ( return home -> pvp -> no name -> check ? 🤷‍♂️)

2. Need to make computer logic
